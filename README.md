## My process

Below is my thinking process of Java Script code:

1. Created consts and regexp
2. Created showError function, that adds error class
3. Created clearError function, that removes error class
4. Created validateEmail function, that filter my input text
5. Created checkForm funtion, that set error active, if input value is empty while submitting
6. Created clearInput function, that clears input and removes error class, if email has been properly sent
7. Created listener on a submit button

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I did this challenge in 15,5h hours. I practiced my flexbox and grid skills but I'm not happy with final result. I had problems with curvy background and I don't know if I did well with my access section (I moved it by translateY and I added padding to my footer section to set proper background change)

I used BEM methodoloy and SCSS.
